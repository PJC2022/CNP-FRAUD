								<p>A USA-based electronics retailer decided to look into an E-Commerce Fraud Solution after chargebacks reached an all-time high of -.42% within a 6-month window. The company had always kept CNP chargebacks at an acceptable level. While the company was aware of the spike in chargebacks, it could not pinpoint why the increase occurred and how to mitigate the loss. </p>
								<p>The company focused on managing the increased sales across all departments and fulfilling the demand for electronic parts and accessories. During their PNL review, the company quickly realized that the in-house fraud mitigation solution was not working. The company sought to implement a reliable solution as soon as possible.</p>
								<p>The CEO, CFO, and COO scheduled a meeting with the leading Risk Solutions provider to gain insight into the loss and how a fraud detection solution could protect the company's profits. The solutions consultant asked qualifying questions about the specific issues they were experiencing, and based on the responses of the prospective client, the fraud solutions test was approved. The company IT department coordinated the requested transactional data for review.</p>
								<p>The transaction data was processed through the fraud solutions algorithm, verifying multiple transaction points, including IP address, Bill To equal to Ship To, AVS (Address Verification Service), Email Age, and Persona Score. The scan revealed glaring weaknesses in the company's current method of preventing E-Commerce Fraud.</p>
								<p>Between mid-August and October, the company AVS was inadvertently disabled after multiple legitimate customers were declined or forced to manual review. The company requested a rule change to the AVS to prevent losing legitimate sales. The declined transactions were also impacting their customer satisfaction scores and branding.</p>

								<p>The bad guys quickly identified the flaw in the payment system and began to purchase high-value computer parts with stolen credit card information. Not only did they use Proxy servers and VPNs to mask their IP address, but the physical address was also a mismatch and not being picked up with the AVS down.</p>

								<p>The company leadership quickly realized the need for tools to verify their online customers. Using multi-point verification checks, including IP address geolocation, billing phone number, address verification system, email age, and bill to ship to verification to identify high-risk transactions, the retailer could have peace of mind. The cost to evaluate each transaction was negligible compared to the loss generated from each chargeback. The Risk Solutions Team identified specific business rules that would reduce the total quantity of manual reviews required by allowing low-risk transactions to process. The retailerâ€™s operational costs would decrease by reducing the required personnel for manual review. Sales would increase as there would be less friction with legitimate customers.</p>
